The Sungard AS Enhanced Snapshots tool is intended for managing backups for infrastructure that is located in the Amazon Web Services cloud. The product will be useful for customers who want to reduce:
* the cost of storing backups
* time spent by IT engineers on routine backup management tasks.

Using to an intuitive interface, you can automate routine tasks such as creation of backups and deletion of old (unused) backups easily. Since these tasks are automated, you will minimize the risks that are associated with human error.

Technical support is not available for the first version of the product. Comments and suggestions can be sent to AWSEnhancedSnapshots@sungardas.com. Customer support service may be added in a future release.

Open source is another important feature of this solution and we plan to create a community that will support it. For the end user, ASM will be free.

# Management Tasks
## Peforming Manual Backups
To perform a backup, the user selects the appropriate EBS volume and clicks the button Backup selected. Also, the user can configure multi-backup, or several volumes during one task. For this, a user selects several appropriate volumes and clicks the button Backup selected. (Backups are performed one at a time.)

## Creating a Schedule
The user can automate the process of creating backups thanks to the Schedule feature. Schedules can be edited with Enhanced Snapshots web UI; schedules are displayed and stored in [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) format. The interval of backups is from one minute to one year. If necessary, schedules can be disabled.

## Managing Retention Policies
The retention policy function that allows the user to automatically delete backups according certain conditions: size limit, count limit days limit.

Only one retention policy can be created for each volume. If a volume does not have any backups, the retention policy cannot be created.

Filters for users are available in order to sort according to different parameters: Volume ID, Name, Size, Instance ID and date of creation.

A list of all users is available in the Users tab. All information about users except their passwords is displayed. Users with admin rights can make changes to all users (even other administrators).
